[shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/)
:::

> The Shiny User Showcase is comprised of contributions from the Shiny app developer community. The apps are categorized into application areas and presented with a brief description, tags, and for many, the source code. Note that many of these apps are winners and honorable mentions of our annual Shiny contest!

[rstudio.github.io/DT/](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)
:::

> The R package DT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables. R data objects (matrices or data frames) can be displayed as tables on HTML pages, and DataTables provides filtering, pagination, sorting, and many other features in the tables.

* Interactive tables

* Tables as inputs

* Editable tables


## reactable

::: {.large style="text-align: center"}
[glin.github.io/reactable/](https://glin.github.io/reactable/)
:::

> Interactive data tables for R, based on the [React Table](https://github.com/tanstack/table/tree/v7) library and made with [reactR](https://github.com/react-R/reactR).

* Sorting, filtering, pagination
* Grouping and aggregation
* Built-in column formatting
* Custom rendering via R or JavaScript
* Expandable rows and nested tables
* Conditional styling


## htmlwidgets

::: {.large style="text-align: center"}
[htmlwidgets.org](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/)
:::

> The htmlwidgets package provides a framework for easily creating R bindings to JavaScript libraries. Widgets created using the framework can be:
>
> * Used at the R console for data analysis just like conventional R plots (via RStudio Viewer).
> * Seamlessly embedded within R Markdown documents and Shiny web applications.
> * Saved as standalone web pages for ad-hoc sharing via email, Dropbox, etc.


## pool

::: {.large style="text-align: center"}
[rstudio.github.io/pool/](https://rstudio.github.io/pool/)
:::

> The goal of the pool package is to abstract away the logic of connection management and the performance cost of fetching a new connection from a remote database. These concerns are especially prominent in interactive contexts, like Shiny apps (which connect to a remote database) or even at the R console.
